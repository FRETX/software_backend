# FretX YouTube Chord Tagger

This is a prototype for a tool that will allow the user to build chord lists for the FretX guitar trainer.
The user will be able to import videos from YouTube using their pasted URL.
Once imported, the user will be able to tag the video with chords synced to the video.
The resulting list can then be exported to allow the chord shapes to be displayed on the FretX.
